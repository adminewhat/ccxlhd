黑料不打烊tttzzz0-黑料不打烊tttzzz09　　荷西：我的理想是具有一栋小小的公寓。我出门获利，Echo在教煮饭给我吃，这是我人生最痛快的事。
　　比起来，现代人弄出酒的方法实在是多的，酒的名目也多，但我觉得最踏实的还是出酒率并不高的天锅冷却法酿制的白酒。

On June 28 - July 2, 2004, 45 points at two o 'clock in the morning, my kind mother walked her the last step of life.
With lung disease tenacious struggle for two years later, finally in the erosion of the disease, chin however finally, forever left we.
Eat: starting from lijiang, if take a taxi, you can eat lunch in jinsha river bank.
Here is famous chicken and ham, ham is famous sanchuan ham, chicken is authentic pheasant, use hot pot cooking, taste very good.
And the price is cheap, generally in 15 yuan per person to eat.
Pleasant jian water after I touch more cheerful, the water will also smile became bright waves, from the mines with human waves also high jump out from time to time between a few happy ShuiZhuEr, whether ShuiZhuEr jump high, however, is to go back to it surrounded by her mother.
Often people who want to stray alone, too, even left the crowd, is the transfer of the body, even if really out of the group, you will have a different from other people's loneliness and look forward to return to the mood of the world, this is your soul.
Once upon a time, civic, like a rolling pin is the most common family daily necessities.
Rolling pin in the hearth, and fire, full of earthly fireworks breath, want to let people warm.
And think of civic, think of the water, think of a landscape, let life how much tenderness.
I a person is in the way of the crops won't grow anymore, feel lost something to warm me.
Over the bridge, it is two big banyan tree in each other's arms into the original village.
How many years, banyan tree or by those people.
Face and some changes have been made in, but I feel that my eyes, bearing, bearing remains unchanged.
I want to farmers in China is never change.
They carry dust, with a hoe and a chat, with the family sitting there, waiting for the sun hot loss, then walked to their fields, close to the seedlings and vegetable, didn't come home until dark.
A man out of the village, a man avoid many years of sunshine outside, I was out of their eyes at some blush with shame.
How much a person walk the path to the old, wear and the village.
The houses on both sides of the road has been old, oblique to the road packed twisting, curved, time is twisting, curved to people hold, and let the winds of the hiding along the walls.
I see HeiWa grow grass, who like being thrown on the non-stick not to place all over the world, what is alive?
Along the way, I can still tell whose house is by the roadside, and clearly know there lived an old couple around the house, has brought up five son of thick.
The old couple are proud because of "support", in the bitter laughter appears life.
And five son to marry daughter-in-law, arguing for housing noise is turned upside down, one by one snapped moved out, another portal, only the old couple bitter to the mouth.
The thing left this village, many people look down upon the old man, always thinking about creating his possessions are truly belong to own, always thinking about ChanGuo just at ease.
No wonder, these old house is behind the big new roof, make whole villages appear expansion and vain, makes me feel less many things in this village.
There are still three big banyan tree in the village.
A tree in the village primary school on the road, two under the road next to the fitness of almost become an organic whole repeatedly.
Tall, stout branches with dense leaves out of the village, a village high head looked at the world outside, listening to the children of lang lang to home, national guard the figure of the old people activities.
The sun came out, the shadow of the big banyan tree over the village.
This life in the shadow of the big banyan tree village, a dream that comes in like a kerosene lamp, year by people Shouting, by horse or carried by pigs, chicken plane, bite by a dog...
One attached to another way.
I walked out of the village from the road, and I walked back to the village from another road.
Such a person to walk on the road, never take a walk after dinner.
Because of the way how many times I wake up in the dream, saw my village.
